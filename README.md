Welcome to the R Package Developer Dashboard, a comprehensive tool designed to streamline the process of tracking and managing CRAN packages.

Key Dashboard Features:
- Package Information: Quickly retrieve and display detailed information about any CRAN package, including the latest version, license, and maintainer details.
- Package Downloads: Visualize and compare package download statistics over time.
- Version Differences: Compare different versions of a package to track changes and updates.
- CRAN Check Results: View CRAN check results.
- Package Dependencies: Analyze package dependencies from user and developer perspective.
- CRAN Releases: Stay updated with all CRAN releases for a package.

This dashboard is primarily powered by the `pacs` package, which is an essential toolkit for R developers looking to gain insights into package development, maintenance, and deployment on CRAN.

What is `pacs` ?

`pacs` is an R package that provides a suite of functions to interact with CRAN packages, analyze dependencies, compare package versions, and much more. It serves as the backbone of this dashboard.
